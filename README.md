# Nutrition Daily Values API
This API provides the recommended Daily Values for nutrients.

## Per the FDA
Daily Values are comprised of two sets of reference values for reporting nutrients in nutrition labels—the Daily Reference Values (DRVs) and the Reference Daily Intakes (RDIs). To limit consumer confusion, the single term “Daily Value” is used to designate both the DRVs and RDIs. The DVs are used to calculate the % Daily Values that consumers see on the Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels. The % Daily Value helps consumers understand how the amount of a nutrient that is present in a serving of a food fits into their total daily diet, and allows them to compare the nutritional value of food products.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, Express.js, Node.js

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.
